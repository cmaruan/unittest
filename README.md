Unittest Library
================

I know that are infinitely unit test libraries for C. 
And this one has nothing special about it
other then that is written by me. 
I decided to write it just for the sake fun and practice. If you find it interesting, use it.
If you have something to contribute about it, do that through a PR.

Keep in mind this isn't fully tested (yet). So use it at your own risk.
